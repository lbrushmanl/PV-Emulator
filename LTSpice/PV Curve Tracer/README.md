After tuning the design in LTSpice I built sections of it on some vero board. 
The first section built was just the tracer. To test this, I used my small PV emulator (Made of diodes and a constant current source LM317).
As I currently don't have a wave gen, I used this website https://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/ on my phone. Because audio waveforms have a negative part, I set up a small circuit to convert it to only positive.
The testing showed that it worked flawlessly.
